<p>Welcome and thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>
  Many years ago I turned my passion for crafting into a small business, to
  share my love of crochet and sewing with others. I can't imagine sitting down
  at home in the evening without picking up my hooks to crochet a blanket or
  two. This simple hobby brings me lots of joy. I always carry odd balls of wool
  and my hooks to events, as I am often asked how to start a blanket, and of
  course I am only too happy to oblige. My lovely Mum, Pat, is an avid knitter
  and all my beautiful cardigans and teddy bear onesies are down to her.

  My stock is always changing and no two items are ever really the same. Check
  out my Gallery page for a selection of my creations. I am always trying out
  new ideas and designs.

<p>I would love to meet you!</p>
